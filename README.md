# Machine-Learning-and-Data-Mining-Project
This project (in collaboration with Anat Ben-Haim) is a Machine Learning and Data Mining Project for classification rainy or not rainy next day
within different areas around Australia.
The project includes a heavy part of pre-processing facing major data problems such as un-balanced target variable, a vast amount of missing data, and high correlation between different variables and also, descriptive statistics, transformations, and feature selection.
Missing data completion was performed by different algorithms that were tested and evaluated, such as Linear regression, KNN, and Random Forest.
The final classification was also evaluated between different algorithms including temporal algorithms such as LSTM.
The best algorithm was found to be a non-temporal algorithm - Random Forest, that was tuned to the best parameters and was tested for over and under sampling for dealing with the unbalanced data issue.
All of the results were evaluated using the F1 score accuracy measure.

Raw data source: Kaggle.
The project was made in Python.
